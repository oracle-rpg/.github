## **About Us**

**Ludic Systems** designs and maintains the ORACLE Game System — a modular tabletop roleplaying game system, designed as the core rules framework for a wide range of narrative-driven games.  Built with clarity, extensibility, and thematic flexibility at its core, the ORACLE Game System provides robust, structured mechanics for character creation, advancement, conflict resolution, and more.

This organisation maintains the development of the ORACLE Game System and curates its associated game titles — each one powered by the **ORACLE Core** framework and tailored to distinct genres, settings, and playstyles.
