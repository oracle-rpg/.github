# **ORACLE Game Systems**

**ORACLE** is a modular tabletop roleplaying game system, designed as the core rules framework for a wide range of narrative-driven games.  Built with clarity, extensibility, and thematic flexibility at its core, the ORACLE system provides robust, structured mechanics for character creation, advancement, conflict resolution, and more.

This organisation maintains the development of the ORACLE system and curates its associated game titles — each one powered by the ORACLE framework and tailored to distinct genres, settings, and playstyles.
